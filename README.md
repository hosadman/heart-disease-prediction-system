# Heart Disease Prediction System

### Introduction
Heart Diseases are a common form of disease in the current wester world. There are many parameters which can be used to ascertain heart disease of a patient. Our objective was to utilize those parameters or features and use a machine learning system to predict whether or not someone is showing symptoms of heart disease.

### Hypothesis
We've used three different machine learning algorithms and comparing the results to find the most suitable one for our project. We'll determine which features to use by using the correlation function in Python.

### Programs used
We've used Python and its Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to write this program.
